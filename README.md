In this 'Forecasting Net Prophet Assignment', I used Mercadolibre time series search trend data, sales data, and stock price data. 
I was able to use hvplots to visualize this data, and I clearly observed the effects of the pandemic on all 3 data sources in my line graphs. 

Line graphs of search trends and the supporting data allowed me to determine the most popular times of the year, week, day, and hour for searches of Mercadolibre. My prepared heatmap allowed me to determine time of day on specific days that were the most popular for the company, supplying further insight into the company's trending status. 

Search data provides a story for the Mercadolibre stock price, and manipulating this data can empower company strategists to discover inflection points in company performance down to the hour of the day it occurred.  

Within the project file, you can also view my recommendations based on projections for sales data next quarter. Base, worst-case, and best-case values can allow Mercadolibre to plan for all scenarios as it delivers e-commerce solutions for others.
